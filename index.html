        <br>
        <p> This is my second year at OSU-Cascades. I am currently a Liberal Studies major, but after I graduate I want to be a teacher. I plan on pursuing my masters in Mathematics Education. Check out my <a href="#Resume">resume</a> below for more information! Or scroll through my portfolio to see what I learned during CS 160!</p>
        <br>
        <p> Over the course of CS 160, I have learned a lot about myself as an individual that is not planning on entering the computer science field. I've discovered how much I enjoy problem solving and having a creative outlet. This experience hasn't been easy. At times it has felt less like a walk in the park and more like fording a river. Initially I had my hand held as I dipped my toe into the water. As we moved deeper into projects, I waded deeper into the water, and at times, fought to keep myself afloat. At the conclusion of this portfolio, I've almost reached the opposite shore. There may be many more rivers in my future, but I've already managed to cross one. </p>
