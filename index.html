      <p> 
      I'm a second year student at OSU-Cascades. I am a Liberal Studies major, but I'm working to become a teacher. I plan on pursuing my masters degree in secondary math education. Check out my resume below for more information!</p>
      <br>
      <p> Over the course of CS 160, I have learned a lot about myself as an individual that is not planning on entering the computer science field. I've discovered how much I enjoy problem solving and having a creative outlet. This experience hasn't been easy. At times it has felt less like a walk in the park and more like fording a river. Initially I had my hand held as I dipped my toe into the water. As we moved deeper into projects, I waded deeper into the water, and at times fought to keep myself afloat. At the conclusion of this portfolio, I've almost reached the opposite shore. There may be many more rivers in my future, but I've already managed to cross one. </p>
